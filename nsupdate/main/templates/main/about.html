<h1>About this service</h1>
    <h2>What's this?</h2>
        <p>
            nsupdate.info is a dynamic dns service.
        </p>
        <p>
            You usually need it so your router (or other dyndns2-compatible
            client) can update a hostname, so you don't need to know or find
            out your current IP address.
        </p>
    <h2>Why another one?</h2>
        <p>
            We wanted a simple, usable, secure and free dynamic dns service.
            That is not nagging its users with spam, having
            to log in regularly or cancelling his hosts after a short time of non-usage.
            That is not hiding the few free features almost undiscoverable between
            a ton of features that are only for paying users.
        </p>
    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>
            Just some geeks wanting some free and open source software and a free service.
        </p>
