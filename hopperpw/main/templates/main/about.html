        <h3>What's this?</h3>
        <p>
        hopper.pw is a free dynamic DNS service, as well as an
        <a href="https://github.com/asmaps/hopper.pw"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i>open source software project</a>.

        <h3>What the heck is (dynamic) DNS!?</h3>
        <p>
        DNS stands for Domain Name System. This is the "addressbook" of the internet:
        Every device in the internet has an IP address - but because people are bad at
        remembering numbers DNS translates easy to remember names to IP addresses.<br>
        Your router at home also is a device in the internet, so it has an IP address -
        but oh... it does NOT automatically have a DNS entry. Also your IP address
        changes regularly. To update a DNS entry most routers have the option to report
        their IP address to a dynamic DNS service (like hopper.pw) if it changed.
        So you can reach your home router from the internet at anytime (e.g. for remote
        administration or switching off the lights)

        <h3>Where do I get a domain (DNS entry) from?</h3>
        <p>
        As part of the free service hopper.pw offers a subdomain (&lt;something&gt;.hopper.pw) for you.
        If you are more advanced, have your own domain and a nsupdate-capable
        DNS server you can add your own domain.

        <h3>Why another dyndns service?</h3>
        <p>
        Yes - there are already various other dyndns services. Buuuuut...
        We were annoyed by always having to click on a link in an email every couple of days
        to prevent the deletion of the domain on other widely spread services and also to always
        try finding the well hidden button for the free accounts. That's why we thought
        "let's host our own service - can't be to difficult!". So during djangodash 2013
        nsupdate.info was born. After the dash the project split into two forks: nsupdate.info
        and hopper.pw.

        <h3>Is it reliable?</h3>
        <p>
        I try to do my best to keep the service up and running.<br>
        But: This is a free service, there are no warranties. If it breaks, it breaks.
